title: Using Parallel Maya
---


Rig performance is vital, and so is understanding what will mess it up! 
This is the whitepaper originally released with the Maya 2016 evaluation engine re-write, and has been consistently updated since then.
In particular the [GPU Override] and [Manipulation] sections are really helpful.  
Keeping deformation stacks on the GPU and tagging your controls so that Maya builds the proper evaluation graph from the get go are really important!
