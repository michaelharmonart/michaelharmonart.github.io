title: Advanced Rigging with De Boors Algorithm in Maya
---


Arcs and Curves are a fundamental principle of design and animation. It turns out that the math behind how curves are interpolated is extremely useful for all sorts of rigging tasks. 
This course by Harry Houghton is an in depth overview and guide for these usecases.

Often all you need to solve a problem is to know it's possible and know the general approach. [This YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9lWRj1iNZs&list=PLBxfGxpYsMjqoFmteUcCd_vbAEPj1-T6x) from the creator of the course is perfect since it gives a broad level overview of each part of the course, and should be enough to get you moving if you're already familiar with some of the concepts.

If you aren't familiar with spline/curve math [this article](/clippings/matrix-splines) by Cole O'Brien is a great free resource.
